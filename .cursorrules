# Cursor Rules for Daily Work Journal System

## Project Context
This is a comprehensive daily work journal system that captures:
- Cursor IDE activity and development work
- Slack team communications and context
- Daily todos, achievements, and reflections
- Learning and insights from daily work

## File Organization
- `scripts/` - Executable shell scripts for journal generation
- `config/` - Configuration files (LaunchAgent plist)
- `logs/` - Daily journal markdown files (moved from ~/doc/journal/)

## Journal Structure
Each daily journal includes:
- Todos (carried over from previous day)
- Cursor activity (files modified, git commits, projects)
- Slack context (team communications, feedback, action items)
- Meetings and collaboration notes
- Learning and insights
- Challenges and blockers
- Achievements and wins
- Reflection and planning for tomorrow

## Integration Points
- **Cursor Activity**: Automatically pulls from cursor-logging system
- **Slack MCP**: Provides guided commands to populate team context
- **Git Integration**: Captures commits and repository changes
- **Daily Automation**: Runs at 9 AM via macOS LaunchAgent

## Usage Patterns
- Journal auto-generates each morning at 9 AM
- Use Slack MCP commands to populate team context
- Update throughout the day with activities and insights
- Review and plan for tomorrow at end of day
- Carry over incomplete todos to next day's journal

## Slack MCP Integration
The system provides specific MCP commands to run in Cursor:
- Get my messages from today
- Search for project mentions
- Check team feedback on tools
- Look for action items and follow-ups
- Monitor current status and reminders
